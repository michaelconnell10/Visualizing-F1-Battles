Intro

Even if you are new to Formula 1, the concept of the "teammate qualifying battle". It's a simple concept - its simply the comparison of performance between teammates during qualifying. 
And it follows a sound line of logic - your teammate is the only other person on the grid driving the exact same machinery as you, so how well/poor you are performing is relative to
their performance.

Additional Info
Even though it would be really simple to just Google the results, copy them into an Excel spreadsheet, and visualize this there. I have always wanted to create projects that can be
easily built off of (either by me or by other developers). What I mean by this is that by building this out in Python (and utilizing the FastF1 API), it means that only a few changes
in the code allows us to either move the comparison to another season or add in additional seasons to the mix.
